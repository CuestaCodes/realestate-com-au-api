The serenity & seclusion here is breathtaking, you will find yourself immersed in an impressive range of mature exotic trees & gardens originally developed by the nurseryman Carl Nobelius.  Surrounded by a canopy of oak trees, maples & silver beech, the idyllic homestead rises to meet you and encourages you further up the impressive stone staircase.<br/><br/>Originally part of the Emerald Country Club Estate, this local landmark dates to the 1920's when it was used as a holiday resort. It not only retains this sense of retreat from the world but many original features, lovingly restored and reinvigorated by some modern comforts and additions. <br/><br/>Simply stunning Art deco lead light doors and windows, high ceilings adorned with period roses combine with the more rustic Australian Heritage rough sawn weatherboards at the gable end of the house. Add to this the luxurious main bathroom and kitchen fit for a chef, and you have a home that has evolved to become a sanctuary.<br/><br/>The kitchen is reminiscent of the English shaker-style. Features here include a Belling 900mm oven, large integrated dishwasher drawer, butler's sink and lantern pattern marble tiles alongside plenty of storage. This heart of the home is warmed by a wood-fired heater and connects the two lounge rooms. Light streams in from the peek-a-boo splashback , the skylight and the wall of patio doors that open to the rear entertaining deck. <br/><br/>Reclaimed messmate flooring is another hero of this space that extends into the main living area that opens to a north facing balcony dappled in sunlight.<br/><br/>Outside you will discover a tiny studio set amongst the gardens that drinks in the surrounding serenity. Work from here, sleep out or simply while away some hours contemplating all that is good. There is also a large double garage plus workshop with remote doors.<br/><br/>Perfectly presented and ready to be enjoyed this property is one that truly welcomes you home.<br/><br/>Due to current road works on Lakeside Drive you may need to approach the property via Lawsons Road. As part of your visit, you may want to allow time for a walk around the old Emerald golf course which is a short stroll away.","[{'id': '2685862', 'name': 'Katie Woods', 'agent_id': '26042136-b473-4f70-ad40-57e6414dbbf2', 'job_title': 'Director', 'url': 'https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/katie-woods-2685862?cid={cid}', 'phone': '0428744498', 'email': None}]"

Huge oak trees were planted well over 100 years ago, back when this property was used as a watering stop for the bullock teams travelling over the hill to the sawmills in Tolmie.  In more recent times, the current owners have completed some thoughtful renovations of the lovely ranch style home, adding creature comforts without losing the relaxed country charm.  The house is as neat as a pin and all the rooms boast lovely views but our favorite spots are both outside, the big deck with panoramic views to the ranges and on the other side of the home a smaller covered alfresco surrounded by lush green lawn.<br/>There are a couple of very useful sheds a short stroll from the house, tucked away beneath some of the amazing trees.  The 4 bay shed boasts a concrete floor and power and includes a very handy workshop and secure storage area.  There's also a second slightly smaller machinery/wood shed.<br/>Water is abundant with 4 tanks that store a total of about 90,000 litres of rainwater plus there's a nice big dam that pumps to 6 points in the garden to help you keep your new oasis nice and green year round.

When this honest workers' cottage was built in the 1930s, the nearby gas works was in round-the-clock production. Perhaps the original owner walked to work there?  Now, this vibrant pocket of Bendigo is home to the Fox and Giraffe Café, the re-imagined Tyson's Reef Hotel, and everyone's favourite, Lake Weeroona. <br/><br/>Number 34 Lucan has changed somewhat too. The vendor has added to the neighbourhood's charm by taking the utmost care in a professional renovation. <br/>The lofty façade gracefully sits behind a heritage wire fence and leafy garden. There is space for up to four vehicles to park off-road, but the stand-out feature is the wide and welcoming deck – more living space than veranda.<br/><br/>There are two bedrooms either side of the entrance hall. One has ruby stained glass side light windows and a gas log fireplace set into the mantlepiece. The other has an exquisite ensuite, with an open shower and duck egg grey basin. The powder room beside, with notable bevelled glass mirror, is cleverly placed for dual access. <br/><br/>Step through to the open-plan, living room to find an expanse of floating bamboo flooring, built-in bookshelves, another beautiful timber mantlepiece and feature pendant lights. To the right, past a European laundry and under a skylight, is the main bathroom. It evokes a little art deco style, in classic, classy black and white.<br/><br/>A third, larger bedroom at the back has a ceiling fan, built-in-robe, and lovely floor-to-ceiling French windows.  The eat-in kitchen is as-new, with a corner pantry, dishwasher and mix of cabinets and pot drawers. The space boasts views of two outdoor alfresco areas; double French colonial doors lead to a grape and wisteria-covered paved patio at the back, or a side deck.<br/><br/>Outside, the property continues to captivate. Who's dreaming of a productive garden with organic fertile soil? This one is brimming with herbs and fruit trees.  Keep the backyard shed as a large storage space, or make use of its power and concrete floor and convert into a studio or outdoor living area.<br/><br/>Walk to the Bendigo Hospital, or take the Bendigo Creek Trail into the city. With such a great location this home has a proven, long-term rental history, and with Bendigo a growing tourist destination just 2.5 hours from Melbourne and Sydney, it would also make a divine B&B.  However, the next owner will likely fall in love at first sight and want to keep this treasure all for themselves.","[{'id': '2128210', 'name': 'Laura Campbell', 'agent_id': '54de38e5-9377-43ad-a938-e64dcfd7e7c9', 'job_title': 'Licensed Estate Agent', 'url': 'https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/laura-campbell-2128210?cid={cid}', 'phone': '0407534950', 'email': None}]"

There are roller shutters across the front of the home and they assist with climate control and of course security.  The home and Shed are set on approximately 2000m2 (1/2 acre).  Now for the Shed.  It is an absolute ripper.  As the property occupies a corner location the Shed enjoys its own separate road frontage/access.  Two large roller doors ensure there is more than ample access for large vehicles and of course there is a small side door for ease of access. The Shed measures approximately 16m x8m x3m and there are some living facilities built in.  But importantly the Shed provides for use as a major workshop, business base, handyman workshop or simply a damn big shed in your backyard.  There is also more than enough room for a caravan to be located beside the Shed plus some extra minor shedding as well.  As we said at the outset what a terrific combo.  Further good news for the buyer is that short term settlement is available so those wanting to purchase and occupy almost immediately thereafter - that is definitely an available option.

We also use this phrase outside of sporting terms to describe the trait of being very versatile. We refer to people and places as All-rounders, when we wish to describe that someone, or something, is very flexible and accommodating. When you inspect this property, you will immediately see what I mean when I say, it's an All-rounder! <br/><br/>The beautiful red brick veneer residence is ideally positioned on the corner of Glenshael Court and Waterford Drive. The block is a generous 829m2 and yet it is nicely low-maintenance, with easy care gardens. The gateway access into the rear yard provides space to store a caravan/boat/trailer. Immediately you will see that the property has broad market appeal. It's ideal for downsizers, first home buyers, families and investors. <br/><br/>The property is currently home to excellent renters and is managed by another local agency. The renters love the property and would be delighted if an investor were to secure it, and wish to offer them a further lease term. However, the renters are also understanding that if you wish to occupy the property yourself, then the lease will come to an end (in early March), to enable vacant possession. <br/><br/>A shady verandah with elegant lacework dresses the front of the home. The pitches in the roofline are architecturally attractive, as are the neat rows of windows; and the way in which the double garage juts out to create a welcoming formal entry to the front door. The internal design of the home is also maximally appealing. There is direct access from the garage into a long hallway with new vinyl plank flooring and a generous storage cupboard. All three bedrooms are well proportioned and have fitted robes. The main is favoured with a walk-in robe and ensuite. The second toilet is separate to the main bathroom, and the adjacent laundry provides a further sink for handwashing. <br/><br/>The heart of the home is the spacious open plan lounge, kitchen and dining area. Cleverly positioned windows and doors allow natural sunlight and warmth to spill into the area as you  desire. You will also be able to easily control natural cross flows of fresh air as you wish. The areas have direct access to the front vernadah, and a sliding door seamlessly connects you to outdoor living, dining and entertaining options. The outdoor living area runs the full length of the back of the home and has a personal access door to the garage. It is incredibly private and is ideally North facing. The backyard is a brilliant size and offers great space for grassy play areas, a veggie patch and gardens. There are great options to add vertical gardens and other low cost, value adds. <br/><br/>There's a real sense of community and a unique energy in Strathfieldsaye. It's a place that's big enough for your family to grow; but is small enough for you to belong. The ever-popular suburb offers highly regarded primary schools, kindergartens, medical clinics, shops and a supermarket. Living here you will enjoy being incredibly well connected to excellent services and amenities. You will also delight in a special connectedness to the natural environment that will surround you.    <br/><br/>Sheepwash Creek and Emu Creek are the main waterways that meander through the beautiful local landscape of gently undulating hills and flats. Walking and cycling paths connect the two sports reserves, and there are numerous playgrounds clustered around the area. Community sporting infrastructure provides for AFL, netball, cricket, lawn bowls, baseball, touch football, tennis, soccer and more. There's no shortage of activities and adventure that await your renters; or you and your family by securing this brilliant property and enviable location.
